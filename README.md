## 🎯 How to Play

1. Player **X** always starts first.
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty square.
3. The game announces the winner when a row, column, or diagonal is filled.
4. If all squares are filled with no winner → **Draw**.
5. Use the **move list** on the side to "time travel" to any past game state.
